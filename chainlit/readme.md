# Welcome to SQL Chatbot with Chainlit! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there, Developer! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board. Chainlit is a powerful tool designed to help you prototype, debug and share applications built on top of LLMs.

Please note that this demo runs on a free Open API account and will therefore have limited (i.e. slow) responses. To improve performance, you can pull the github and link the `apikey` with a premium account.

A demo version of this is currently running on a free AWS E2 instance.

- Entering your postgres server connection details (or using the provided default values) should immediately redirect you to the Chatbot. However, if that doesn't work, then please click the link below.
