# Welcome to SQL Chatbot with Chainlit! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there, Developer! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board. Chainlit is a powerful tool designed to help you prototype, debug and share applications built on top of LLMs.

Please note that this demo runs on a free Open API account and will therefore have limited (i.e. slow) responses. To improve performance, you can pull the github and link the `apikey` with a premium account.

A demo version of this is currently running on a free AWS E2 instance.

[**Postgres Server Connection Page**](http://ec2-3-21-56-191.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/) - This is the page to either enter your postgres server connection details or accept the provided default values. It should immediately redirect you to the Chatbot. However, if that doesn't work, then please click the link below.
